Making a slot machine
    three bar slot machine
        needs to randomly generate three ID's to set as the spin.
            way to set the win condition is to set a break statement 
    six symbols
    use contructor to make the img show up and use price, id, name, and etc.
        three lower symbols
        three premimum
    trigger will be a button that will spin the slot and consume a token.
        spin cost one token
        if no token then game !
        wins will be 1 x icon id
    cash out button
        ends the game and tells you good job for cashing out.

    Functions in my class object.
        One to set win conditions()
            if win condition = array then pay X
        one for making the pictures appear from the spin()
            making the spin animation is possible if we layer picture and gif on top of each other.
            or a question mark with a small animation to hide the symbol while spinning
        one for keeping track of the tokens and currency()

        one to cashout ()
